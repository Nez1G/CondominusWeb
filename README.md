A web solution made using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, JQUERY, AJAX and BOOTSTRAP that allows you to manage condominiums. All the files 
names are in Portuguese because it was a project that I made to the university. The solution works great and it preforms 
functions like create, edit and delete condominiums and their respective fractions and events inside the condominium 
such as meetings, cleaning, etc, calculate all the expenses for each fractions depending on the condominium modality, 
and many many others.
